    Use the following three step procedure:
        1) use binary search to find the lowest index with a value >= x
        2) use binary search to find the lowest index with a value < x
        3) return the difference between step 1 and 2
    I highly recommend creating stand-alone functions for steps 1 and 2
    that you can test independently.
